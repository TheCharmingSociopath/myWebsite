		<h1 style="font-size: larger;">HOPE</h1>

		When I had lost the battle of my life,<br>

		and my heart was broken into pieces;<br>

		when I saw my tools lying shattered,<br>

		and my life was upside down;<br>

		I looked around and saw death,<br>

		the only path I could walk upon.<br>

		 <br>

		I closed my eyes,<br>

		and the warm breeze carried the ashes off my heart;<br>

		a fire burned within me,<br>

		and I rose, for a new dawn had taken birth.<br>

		I smiled, and started to build it again.<br>

		from the ashes.<br>

		 <br>

		Much time has now passed,<br>

		dusk has fallen again.<br>

		I looked at the setting sun,<br>

		and blues filled my heart.<br>

		But I raised my head,<br>

		and my eyes shone with bright;<br>

		I was waiting patiently,<br>

		for a new dawn was yet to come.<br>

			<h1 style="font-size: larger;">The Incredible She</h1>
		
				She walks like a kitten,

				<br>And acts like bitten;

				<br>She talks like a duchess,

				<br>And roars like lioness;

				<br>She feels like a princess,

				<br>And treats like a Satan;

				<br>Yet the heart craves,

				<br>For that one incredible she;

				<br>With that one incredible look,

				<br>And with that fascinating, dumb, chattering wit,

				<br>And with all the glamour she can ever wear,

				<br>To drive you mad,

				<br>To smile you and shake you.

				<br>And then that Satan breaks you,

				<br>Burns you, agonizes you.

				<br>And yet the heart craves,

				<br>For that one incredible she.
